## Creators overview

Each profile includes essential details like name, handle, platform, and profile picture - helping you quickly recognize and differentiate between creators. Here are the important points to cover for this page:

**Connection to Instagram Status**\
You can track whether a creator is connected to Sheer and if they’ve completed the necessary onboarding or account linking. There are three important types of connection status:

- **Green checkmark -** means the influencer is fully connected.
- **A grey cross** **-** means that the influencer has signed-up, but has yet accept the terms and conditions to allow Sheer access to his profiles data.
- **Red Exclamation mark -** means the influencers connection has been disconnected. This simply means they are required to restore connection by logging in to their Sheer account again.

This makes it easy to follow up with pending connections and ensure you’re set up for smooth collaboration. To further assist with creator sign-ups on the Sheer platform - please refer to the Help Center for Creators [here](https://help.sheer.dk/get-started/introduction):

## Mediakits

Creator media kits provides an in-depth look into each individual creator’s audience data & historic performance, helping you make informed decisions when selecting or evaluating influencers for your campaigns. It’s a valuable tool for assessing if their dominant audience aligns with your target audience. If their historic reach and impression on content aligns with your campaign goals.

**For verified profiles, influencer data is pulled directly from Meta.** This means the information is not estimated or third-party aggregated - it’s sourced directly from the platform, giving you accurate and up-to-date insights you can rely on to make informed decisions.

### Audience demographics

- **Audience Demographics**\

- **Country of Origin**\
  See where the majority of the creator’s followers are based. This data helps ensure geographic alignment with your campaign goals.
- **Top Five Cities**\
  In addition to country-level data, the Media Kit highlights the **top five cities** where the influencer's followers are concentrated. This allows for even more precise targeting and can be especially useful for local campaigns.

Each of these insights plays a key role in helping you assess not just the size of an influencer’s audience, but the quality and relevance of it. When combined with campaign performance and content output, the Media Kit gives you a complete picture to guide your influencer strategy.

### Average post performance

Within the **Creator Media Kit**, Sheer provides a detailed view of a creator’s **average post performance** over the past **180 days**. This data gives you a clear sense of how a creator’s content performs across different formats and contexts, helping you make smarter, data-informed decisions.

You can choose to analyze performance by **Posts, Stories,** or **Reels,** depending on the content type most relevant to your campaign. 

Here’s what you can expect to see:

- **Reach**\
  The average number of unique accounts that viewed the content. This helps gauge the creator's ability to consistently get their content in front of people.
- **Reach Efficiency**\
  Reach Efficiency shows how well the influencer converts their follower base into actual viewers. It's calculated as **Reach divided by Follower Count**, expressed as a percentage. A higher Reach Efficiency means the influencer’s content is regularly seen by a large portion of their audience. 

  It is important to note that there are different percentile benchmarks for Reach Efficiency based on the type of content the influencer shares. Content types such as Posts and Reels has the opportunity to be exposed beyond the influencers followerbase and can therefore achieve higher levels of Reach Effeciency, while Stories are locked and are generally only viewed by the influencers own followers. 

  Furthermore, Makro influencers tend to have a much lower Reach Effeciency compared to Micro influencers whos follower base is smaller, but likely more active. 
- **Engagement**\
  The average number of engagements per post. This helps you understand the level of audience interest and involvement.
- **Engagement Rate**\
  Engagement Rate represents the percentage of the audience that interacts with the content. It’s calculated as **Engagement divided by Reach**, offering a normalized metric that compares creators of different sizes on an even playing field.
- **Impressions**\
  The total number of times the content was viewed, including multiple views from the same user. This helps measure total visibility and content repetition, which can be especially valuable in campaigns focused on brand recall.

This performance snapshot offers a strong benchmark of how a creator typically performs across cotnent types. It’s particularly helpful when assessing potential collaborators or evaluating the success of ongoing partnerships.

#### Sponsored vs. non-sponsored posts

The data includes both **organic content** and **sponsored content**, allowing you to directly compare how the influencer performs in day-to-day posting versus paid brand collaborations.
