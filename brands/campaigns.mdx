For each campaign, you will find and overview of:

**Campaign Name & Details**\
Each campaign is listed with its title and essential information. This includes brief descriptions, or internal notes that help your team quickly identify the campaign’s purpose or theme. Whether you're running seasonal promotions, product launches, or long-term partnerships, everything can be neatly descriped in the campaign titel with further room for specifications in the description tab.

**Status**\
The status indicator shows you where each campaign currently stands in the process. It could be marked as _Draft_, _Active_, _Completed, or Archived_. This helps you prioritize actions -for example, reviewing upcoming campaigns, optimizing & edit active ones, or analyzing completed performance.

**Period**\
The campaign period displays the duration of each campaign, from its scheduled start date to the planned or actual end date. This gives you a clear understanding of your marketing calendar and allows for better planning across multiple initiatives. Sheer will sort all of the campaigns in chronological order of the _Start date_. The campaign period can be manually edited later on to fit your specific wish for a display order.

**Influencer Preview**\
You’ll see a preview of the influencers and total number of creators attached to each campaign -typically shown as profile thumbnails or names.
