#### **Organic vs. boosted performance data**

Since data is pulled directly from Sheer, all organic data is provided directly from the platform, whether Meta or TikTok. However, if paid media is applied on a post, then the data in Sheer varies based on if your creator is on Instagram or TikTok

- Instagram - influencer data is \*\*always organic data. \*\*Sheer will differentiate between organic and paid performance, and only show organic performance.
- TikTok - Influencer data shown is **both organic and paid together**. This means that if paid media is applied, Sheer will not be able to differentiate between the data.
  - **Tip!** If you plan to add paid media on your TikTok campaign, then export the report data, or simply grab a screenshot of the influencers specific post that is to be boosted. That insures you also have the organic data available at later stages of reporting.

## Edit report

Adding new influencer posts to your report can be done in an instant. Simply select the Edit Report button, scroll down to the influencer and click add post.

- For creators on Instagram, you are able to select posts, stories or reels.
  - **Important!** To track stories, the creator is required to be connected to Sheer prior to posting the story. If your creator is connected, you can always add stories that have expired on the influencers profile to your report at a later date.
