- **Reach Efficiency** - How well the influencer converts their follower base into actual viewers. It's calculated as Reach divided by Follower Count, expressed as a percentage. A higher Reach Efficiency means the influencer’s content is regularly seen by a large portion of their audience.
- **Interactions** - The average number of engagements per post such as likes, comments, saves, shares.
- **Interaction Rate** - Interactions divided by Reach, offering a normalized metric that compares creators of different sizes on an even playing field.
