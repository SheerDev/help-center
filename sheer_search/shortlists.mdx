title: "Shortlists"
description: "Shortlists are customizable, self-managed influencer lists in Sheer that help you keep track of creators of special interest, future collaborations, or specific campaigns. Think of them as your personal folders for organizing influencer profiles - whether you’re curating a dream team for an upcoming campaign or simply saving top-performing creators."

### Why Use Shortlists?

- **Organize Smarter**\
  Build different lists for different campaigns, regions, niches, or internal stages (e.g. “To Review,” “Top Picks,” “Not a Fit”).
- **Collaborate Easily**\
  Share lists with team members or clients for feedback or approval, keeping everyone aligned on influencer selection.
- **Save Time**\
  Don’t repeat the same search work. Add influencers once, then refine, track, and revisit as needed.
- **Create an influencer network within your organization**

  As covered in the Public Search section, you are able to search within your created shortlists to filter through influencers already found. As your organization creates more and more shortlists, your internal network of high quality creators will become a highly valuable resource, as you can apply filters specific for your next project to find the exact matches.

  We plan to expand the features of shortlists to make the mangement of even better with adding a tags system, copy & merge functions, and more, so stay tuned at create your shortlists today\!

### Key Features of Shortlists

✅ **Apply Advanced Filters to Shortlists**

You can filter profiles within your list using the same filters available in Public Search. This lets you assess how your saved influencers stack up against your campaign goals when reviewing your lists.

> **Example:** You’ve created a list of 100 creators for an upcoming beauty campaign in Denmark. Use filters to find only those with more than 65% of their followers being female, located in Denmark to ensure reaching the targeted audience for the campaign.

✅ **View Audience & Performance Data**

Once influencers are on your Shortlist, you have full access to their estimated data, including:

- Audience demographics.
- General Creator info.

> **Use case:** Continually evaluate your saved influencers without leaving the Shortlist, ensuring they’re still a good fit as campaign details evolve.

✅ **Add & Remove Influencers Seamlessly**

Easily manage Shortlists by adding new profiles as you discover them or removing those who no longer meet your criteria. Everything updates instantly across your workspace.
